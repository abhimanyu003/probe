## Overview

Probe use `jq` as JSON query processor

`jq` is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.


ðŸ‘‰ More details on jq: [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)


**Some JQ Playgrounds**

* [JQPlay](https://jqplay.org/)
* [JQTerm](https://jqterm.com/?query=.) ( amazing one )


Lets say if you have API JSON output which looks like this.

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

**Use "probe" to test**

* Create a file with name `main.yaml` ( filename can be anything )

```yaml
name: Writing Test
stages:
  - name: first stage
    request:
      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'
      method: GET
    assert:
      body:
        - select: .userId # jq query language
          want: 1
        - select: .title # jq query language
          want: "delectus aut autem"
```
> ðŸ’¡ Here `select: .userId` and `select: .title` is jq query language.

## Assert Response Status Code

Assert response status code like `200`, `404`, `500` etc.

```yaml
assert:
  status: 200 # provide valid response header code
```

### Example

```yaml
name: Assert response status
stages:
  - name: test todo endpoint
    request:
      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'
      method: GET
    assert:
      status: 200 # assert of response status code
```


## Assert Response Headers

It's also possible to assert response headers.

```yaml
assert:
  status: 200
  headers:
    - select: # select header key
      want: # header value
```

### Example

```yaml
name: Assert header
stages:
  - name: test todo endpoint
    request:
      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'
      method: GET
    assert:
      status: 200
      headers:
        - select: pragma
          want: "no-cache"
```

## Assert JSON field

You can validate JSON fields, using `constrain` tags

```
constrain:json
```

### Example

```yaml
name: Test JSON field
stages:
  - name: first user
    request:
      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1'
      method: GET
    assert:
      body:
        - select: .address.geo # assert json field
          constrain: json # json constrain tag
          want: |
            {
              "lat": "-37.3159",
              "lng": "81.1496"
            }
```

## More Live Examples

JSON response from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1)

It looks something like this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Leanne Graham",
  "username": "Bret",
  "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
  "address": {
    "street": "Kulas Light",
    "suite": "Apt. 556",
    "city": "Gwenborough",
    "zipcode": "92998-3874",
    "geo": {
      "lat": "-37.3159",
      "lng": "81.1496"
    }
  },
  "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
  "website": "hildegard.org",
  "company": {
    "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
    "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
    "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
  }
}
```

To test the above endpoint using probe

* Create a `main.yaml` file with this

```yaml
name: Test User
stages:
  - name: test first user
    request:
      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1'
      method: GET
    assert:
      status: 200
      body:
        - select: .email
          want: "Sincere@april.biz"
        - select: .address.street
          want: "Kulas Light"
        - select: .address.geo
          constrain: json
          want: |
            {
              "lat": "-37.3159",
              "lng": "81.1496"
            }
```
