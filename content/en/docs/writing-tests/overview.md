## Overview

Probe makes it easy to write end-to-end API tests using YAML and JQ.

This section illustrates how to write a simple test suite with Probe, and what are the conventions you should use.

The setup is very simple looks like this:

```yaml
name: name of test
stages: # a test can multiple stages
  - name: name of stage
    request:
      # request builder here
    assert:
      status: # assert response status code ( eg: 200, 404, 500 )
      headers:
        # things you want to assert in header
      body:
        # things you want to assert
```

Probe use `jq` as JSON query processor

`jq` is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

You can use all the functions and power of jq ðŸ™‚

### Quick Example

* Create a file `main.yaml` ( filename can be anything )

```yaml
name: Writing Test
stages:
  - name: first stage
    request:
      url: "https://httpbin.org/get"
      method: GET
    assert:
      status: 200
```


* Running test


```
$ probe run
```


## Stages

A test is required to have a `stage`, which allow your to send HTTP Request and Assert Body.
Test can have multiple `stages`, stages run in sequential order.

```yaml
name: name of test
stages: # a test can multiple stages
  - name: first stage
    request:
      # request for first stage here
    assert:
      # things you want to assert

  - name: second stage
    request:
      # request for second stage here
    assert:
      # things you want to assert
```

### Example: Single Stage Test

* Create a file with name `main.yaml` ( filename can be anything )


```yaml
name: Writing Test
stages:
  - name: first stage
    request:
      url: "https://httpbin.org/get"
      method: GET
    assert:
      status: 200
```

### Example: Multiple Stage Test

* Create a file with name `main.yaml` ( filename can be anything )

```yaml
name: Writing Test
stages:
  - name: first stage
    request:
      url: "https://httpbin.org/get"
      method: GET
    assert:
      status: 200

  - name: second stage
    request:
      url: "https://httpbin.org/post"
      method: POST
    assert:
      status: 200
```
* Running test

```
$ probe run
```
